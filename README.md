This project was part of my university course to develop a solution to a problem. As a team we chose to create a student budget calculator using .net MAUI. This allowed us to create a mobile app and a desktop app at the same time.
Due to time restrictions on the module this work was never finished and does not have full functionality. I may continue to work on this again in the future.

This prject was coded by Harry Atkinson.
Joshua contributed by coding the LoginPage.xaml
